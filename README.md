# DARE Update
Public release of DARE Update - NOTE: Product requires a license from DARE Technology Ltd for full use.

DARE Update's purpose is to deliver automated third party macOS Application updates as quickly as possible with minimal impact on user experience, as well as providing a method of easily deploying up to date third party Apps from your MDM.

The wikis included are intended for DARE Update customers and provide an overview on how to configure and manage DARE Update going forward.

DARE Update is MDM agnostic, however as a minimum you need to be able to deploy PKG files as well as custom configuration profiles via your MDM. Throughout the wikis we will be using Jamf Pro for the deployment and configuration, but the same logic can be applied with other MDMs.

Please use the [included wikis](https://wwww.dareupdate.co)  for a technology overview, as well as full administrator's guides relating to deploying and managing DARE Update.
